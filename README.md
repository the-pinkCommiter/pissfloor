# Project PF (pissfloor)
"Guaranteed as the world's most beta-est hack ever!"

EST. 2024

Project "pissfloor" is a parody hack meant to poke fun of Mario 64 beta hacks (e.g. mariosan's, dudaw's, bee, etc). Without the existing release of [TPP](https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/tpp-mirror) and the reimplementation which is [showfloor](https://github.com/96flashbacks/showfloor), this hack would have not been possible.

## Q&A
