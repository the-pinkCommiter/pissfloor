## Introduction

**showfloor** is a recreation of the Shoshinkai 1995 demo of Super Mario 64, based on [The Preservation Project](https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/tpp-mirror) (TPP). It aims to continue TPP's legacy with greater accuracy to the source material.

## Installation

The build process is the same as the [SM64 Decomp's](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64).
Follow their [README](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64/blob/master/README.md#installation) for setup steps and prerequisites (dependencies, baserom, etc).

Clone and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/96flashbacks/showfloor.git
cd showfloor
make
```

### RSP Microcode

This project uses the same `GRUCODE` build variable as the SM64 Decomp, but with different options.

Default is `f3d_102695`.

- `f3d_102695`: gspFast3D from Ultra 64 OS release 102695 (U64 Aging Cartridge). Not HLE-compatible.
- `f3d_20E`: gspFast3D from OS 2.0E (bbgames' ostrees). HLE-compatible.

Build with a specific microcode:

```sh
make GRUCODE=f3d_20E
```

## Q&A

**Can I use this as a base for another project?**
- Yes, but not recommended, as many vanilla assets were removed or edited, so you'd need to re-add them.

**Can I contribute to this repository?**
- Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to report problems or suggest improvements, and feel free to submit pull requests.
